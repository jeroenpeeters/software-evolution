# A list of usability criteria for the visualization. #
#######################################################

1. Self-describing
   
   The visualisation should be self-describing. At best, no explanation is needed.
   
2. Linking

   The visualisation should link to the applicable code fragment so the user can
   manually inspect the code represented by the visualisation.
   
3. Interactive

   The visualisation should be interactive, clicking on a visualisation fragment shows
   more detailed information or another visualisation.
   
4. Clarity

   Items represented in the visualisation which are not the same should also be represented
   differently, either by a different color, size, shape. It should be clear why the colors 
   are different and what it means.
   
5. Keep it simple

   Don't overwelm the user with too much (irrelevant) information. Instead use interactivity 
   to allow the user to dive into a particular item of interest.
